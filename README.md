Note:<br>
This is what I experienced.
We ranked 4 in inter college coding competition in 1st year and had a good realization. Tried to organize the same in our college [GCECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College_of_Engineering_and_Ceramic_Technology) afterwards. <br>
We kept on exploring new things, [algorithmica](http://www.algorithmica.co.in/course1.php) also strengthen our path. <br>
Cleared interviews like Teradata, Teletext, Infosys, CTS, Accenture, Jp morgan, Harman(2x), Siemens(3x), Morgan Stanley, Amazon, Hexagon, Philips, KLA etc..
